It could be a specific event or a set of criteria that the index \\(i\\) must satisfy.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe core purpose of this equation is to indicate whether a certain condition (in this case, \"objective\") is satisfied for a given index \\(i\\). If the condition is met, the indicator function returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0. This is a common way to represent binary conditions in mathematical expressions.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The indicator function } \\mathbbm{1}_i^{\\text{ objective}} \\text{ indicates whether the condition \"objective\" is satisfied for the index } i.}\n\\]"
