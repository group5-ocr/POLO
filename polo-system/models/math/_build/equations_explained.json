      "explanation": "assistant\n### Explanation\n\nThe given equations are:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbb{E}(X_n^2) \\leq N\\cdot P \n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbb{E}(\\overline{X}_n^2) \\leq N\\cdot \\overline{P}\n\\]\n\nLet's break down each part of the equations step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Summation Notation:**\n   - The symbol \\(\\sum\\) represents the sum of a sequence.\n   - The index \\(n\\) starts at 1 and goes up to \\(N\\).\n   - \\(\\mathbb{E}(X_n^2)\\) represents the expected value of the square of the random variable \\(X_n\\).\n   - \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) represents the sample mean of the random variable \\(X_n\\).\n   - \\(\\overline{P}\\) represents the sample proportion of the random variable \\(P\\).\n\n2. **Interpreting the Inequalities:**\n   - The first inequality states that the sum of the expected values of the squares of \\(N\\) random variables \\(X_n\\) is less than or equal to \\(N\\) times the expected value of the square of a constant \\(P\\).\n   - The second inequality states that the sum of the expected values of the squares of the sample means of \\(N\\) random variables \\(\\overline{X}_n\\) is less than or equal to \\(N\\) times the expected value of the square of a sample proportion \\(\\overline{P}\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both inequalities are essentially stating that the sum of the expected values of the squares of the random variables (or their sample means) is bounded by a linear function of the expected value of the square of a constant or a sample proportion.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbb{E}(X_n^2) \\leq N\\cdot P, \\quad \\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbb{E}(\\overline{X}_n^2) \\leq N\\cdot \\overline{P}}\n\\]\n\nassistant\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbb{E}(X_n^2) \\leq N\\cdot P, \\quad \\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbb{E}(\\overline{X}_n^2) \\leq N\\cdot \\overline{P}}\\)."
