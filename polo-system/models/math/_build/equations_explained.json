The double subscript \\(ij\\) indicates that the function is applied to the pair \\((i, j)\\).\n3. ** \\( \\text{ objective} \\)**: This is the label for the indicator function, which in this context is \"objective\".\n\nSo, the indicator function \\(\\mathbbm{1}_{ij}^{\\text{ objective}}\\) is 1 if the condition is met (i.e., if the pair \\((i, j)\\) is part of the \"objective\" set), and 0 otherwise.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe core purpose of this equation is to indicate whether a certain pair \\((i, j)\\) is part of the \"objective\" set. If the pair is part of the \"objective\" set, the value of the indicator function is 1; otherwise, it is 0.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion can be summarized as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The indicator function } \\mathbbm{1}_{ij}^{\\text{ objective}} \\text{ indicates whether the pair } (i, j) \\text{ is part of the \"objective\" set.}}\n\\]"
