The confidence score is a measure of how likely it is that the object exists in the grid cell and how well the predicted box matches the ground truth box.

If the object exists, the probability term is a value between 0 and 1, and the confidence score is the similarity score between the predicted box and the ground truth box.\n\n### Variablelist\n\n- **\\(\\Pr(\\textrm{Object})\\)**: Probability that the object exists in the grid cell.\n- **\\(\\textrm{IOU}_{\\textrm{Pred}}^{\\textrm{truth}}\\)**: Intersection over Union score between the predicted box and the ground truth box.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe equation computes the confidence score for a predicted object.

The equation is:\n\nHere's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **\\(\\Pr(\\textrm{Class}_i | \\textrm{Object})\\)**: This represents the probability that an object belongs to a specific class \\(i\\), given that there is an object in the image.

TheIOU score is a measure of how well the predicted box fits the object. It is calculated as the area of the intersection of the predicted box and the object divided by the area of the union of the predicted box and the object.\n\n4. **\\(\\Pr(\\textrm{Class}_i)\\)**: This represents the probability that a box contains the class \\(i\\). This is the probability of the event that a box contains a specific class.\n\n5. ****: This is the same as the intersection over union score for the predicted box.\n\nThe equation states that the product of the probability that an object belongs to a specific class given that there is an object in the image, the probability that there is an object in the image, and theIOU score for the predicted box is equal to the probability that a box contains the class multiplied by theIOU score for the predicted box.\n\nThis equation is used to compute the confidence scores for each box in the image. The confidence scores are a combination of the probability that the box contains the class and theIOU score for the predicted box. This allows the model to score the boxes based on both the probability of the class and the fit of the box to the object.\n\nIn conclusion, the equation is used to compute the confidence scores for each box in the image, taking into account the probability that the box contains the class and theIOU score for the predicted box. This helps the model to score the boxes based on both the probability of the class and the fit of the box to the object.\n\nThe final answer is:"

The leaky ReLU function is a type of Rectified linear unit ( ReLU ) that has a small slope for negative inputs to help with the training of feed forward and feed forward models.\n\nThe leaky ReLU function is defined as:\n\\[\n\\phi(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    x, & \\text{if } x > 0\\\\\n    0.1x, & \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThis means that for any positive input \\( x \\), the function returns the input value \\( x \\) itself. For any non-positive input \\( x \\) (i.e., \\( x \\leq 0 \\)), the function returns \\( 0.1x \\), which is a small positive value.\n\nLet's break down the function step by step:\n\n1. **Case 1: \\( x > 0 \\)**\n   - If the input \\( x \\) is positive, the function simply returns the input value \\( x \\).\n   - For example, if \\( x = 5 \\), then \\( \\phi(5) = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Case 2: \\( x \\leq 0 \\)**\n   - If the input \\( x \\) is non-positive (i.e., zero or negative), the function returns \\( 0.1x \\).\n   - For example, if \\( x = -5 \\), then \\( \\phi(-5) = 0.1 \\times (-5) = -0.5 \\).\n\nThe leaky ReLU function is used in machine learning models to introduce non linearity into the model. The small slope for negative inputs helps to prevent the gradients from becoming too small, which can help with the training of deep feed forward models.\n\nIn the context of the paper, the leaky ReLU function is used to process the outputs of the previous layer in a feed forward model.
