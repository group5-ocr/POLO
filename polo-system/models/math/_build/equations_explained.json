This means we will add up the results of the expression for each value of \\(i\\) from 1 to \\(n\\).\n\n2. **Weight (W)**: \\(w_i\\) represents the weight associated with the \\(i\\)-th term. The weight is squared, so we have \\(w_i^2\\).\n\n3. **Input (X)**: \\(x_i\\) represents the input value for the \\(i\\)-th term. This input value is squared, so we have \\(x_i^2\\).\n\n4. **Phi Function (Phi)**: \\(\\Phi(x)\\) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. It gives the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to \\(x\\).\n\n5. **Expression**: The entire expression inside the summation is \\(\\Phi(x) (1 - \\Phi(x))\\).
