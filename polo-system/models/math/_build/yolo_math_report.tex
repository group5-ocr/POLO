Let's break down the given equation \( S \times S \) step by step.

### Example
The equation \( S \times S \) can be written exactly as LaTeX in a single block as:
\[ S \times S \]

### Explanation
The symbol \( S \) represents a set. The expression \( S \times S \) denotes the Cartesian product of the set \( S \) with itself. The Cartesian product of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a \) is an element of \( A \) and \( b \) is an element of \( B \). In this case, since both sets are \( S \), the Cartesian product \( S \times S \) is the set of all ordered pairs \((s_1, s_2)\) where both \( s_1 \) and \( s_2 \) are elements of \( S \).

### Conclusion
The core purpose of the equation \( S \times S \) in the context of the paper could be to represent the set of all possible pairs of elements from the set \( S \). This is often used in various mathematical and statistical contexts, such as in probability theory or machine learning, where the Cartesian product is used to define the sample space of a random variable or to represent the set of all possible outcomes of a pair of events.

Therefore, the conclusion could be:
The equation \( S \times S \) represents the set of all ordered pairs of elements from the set \( S \), which is useful in contexts where the Cartesian product is used to define the sample space or possible outcomes of a pair of events.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{S \times S}

Let's break down the given equation step by step, following the order you've specified.

### Example
The equation is:
\[
\Pr(\textrm{ Object}) * \textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}}
\]

### Explanation
1. **\(\Pr(\textrm{ Object})\)**: This represents the probability of the event "Object". In simpler terms, it's the likelihood that a certain event (the "Object") occurs.
2. **\(\textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}}\)**: This part of the equation is a bit more complex. It seems to represent a function or a specific value related to the "推" (推断) and "真" (实际) in the context of the paper. Without more context, it's hard to provide a more specific explanation, but generally, it could be a measure of how well the推ulation matches the true value.

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to calculate the probability of an event (the "Object") and then multiply it by a measure of how well a推ulation matches the true value. This could be useful in various contexts, such as machine learning or statistical analysis, where we need to evaluate the likelihood of an event and its accuracy.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\text{The equation calculates the probability of an event and then multiplies it by a measure of how well a推ulation matches the true value.}}

Let's break down the given equation step by step, following the instructions provided.

### Example
The equation is:
\[
\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{ Object})
\]

### Explanation
This equation represents the probability that an object belongs to a specific class \(i\), given the object. Here's a breakdown of the symbols and their meanings:

1. \(\Pr\): This is the probability function.
2. \(\textrm{Class}_i\): This represents the class to which the object belongs.
3. \(\textrm{Object}\): This represents the object itself.
4. \(|\): This is the conditional probability operator, meaning "given".

So, the equation \(\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{Object})\) means "the probability that the object belongs to class \(i\), given the object itself".

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to determine the probability that a given object belongs to a specific class. This is a common task in machine learning and pattern recognition, where the goal is often to classify objects into different categories based on their features.

### Final Answer

Let's break down the given equation step by step, following the order you've specified.

### Example
The equation is:
\[
\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{ Object}) * \Pr(\textrm{ Object}) * \textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}} = \Pr(\textrm{Class}_i) * \textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}}
\]

### Explanation
1. **\(\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{ Object})\)**: This represents the probability that an object belongs to a certain class \(i\), given the object itself.
2. **\(\Pr(\textrm{Object})\)**: This represents the probability of the object itself.
3. **\(\textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}}\)**: This represents the information used for推断 (inference) and the truth of that information.
4. **\(\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i)\)**: This represents the probability of the class \(i\) without any condition on the object.

The equation essentially states that the product of the probability of an object belonging to a certain class given the object itself, the probability of the object, and the truth of the information used for推断 is equal to the probability of the class multiplied by the truth of the information used for推断.

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to show that the probability of an object belonging to a certain class, given the object itself, and the probability of the object itself, is proportional to the probability of the class and the truth of the information used for推断. This equation is a fundamental part of the paper's argument, likely used to support a larger argument about loss composition, normalization, coordinate error, probability/log-likelihood, etc.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{Object}) * \Pr(\textrm{Object}) * \textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}} = \Pr(\textrm{Class}_i) * \textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推

### Example
\[ S \times S \]

### Explanation
The symbol \( S \) represents a set. The expression \( S \times S \) denotes the Cartesian product of the set \( S \) with itself. The Cartesian product of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a \) is an element of \( A \) and \( b \) is an element of \( B \). In this case, since both sets are \( S \), the Cartesian product \( S \times S \) is the set of all ordered pairs \((s_1, s_2)\) where \( s_1 \) and \( s_2 \) are elements of \( S \).

### Conclusion

   - \( B*5 + C \) means the result of \( B*5 \) is being added to \( C \).
   - Finally, the entire expression \( S^2 \times (B*5 + C) \) means \( S^2 \) is being multiplied by the result of \( B*5 + C \).

3. **Conclusion**: The core purpose of this equation is to calculate a value that is the product of \( S^2 \) and the sum of \( B*5 \) and \( C \). This could be useful in various contexts, such as in machine learning models where it might represent a loss function or a score calculation.

\[
\phi(x) =
\begin{cases}
    x, & \text{if } x > 0\\
    0.1x, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
