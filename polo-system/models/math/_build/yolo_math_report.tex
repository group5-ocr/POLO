### Explanation

The given equations are:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^N\mathbb{E}(X_n^2) \leq N\cdot P 
\]
\[
\sum_{n=1}^N\mathbb{E}(\overline{X}_n^2) \leq N\cdot \overline{P}
\]

Let's break down each part of the equations step by step.

1. **Understanding the Summation Notation:**
   - The symbol \(\sum\) represents the sum of a sequence.
   - The index \(n\) starts at 1 and goes up to \(N\).
   - \(\mathbb{E}(X_n^2)\) represents the expected value of the square of the random variable \(X_n\).
   - \(\overline{X}_n\) represents the sample mean of the random variable \(X_n\).
   - \(\overline{P}\) represents the sample proportion of the random variable \(P\).

2. **Interpreting the Inequalities:**
   - The first inequality states that the sum of the expected values of the squares of \(N\) random variables \(X_n\) is less than or equal to \(N\) times the expected value of the square of a constant \(P\).
   - The second inequality states that the sum of the expected values of the squares of the sample means of \(N\) random variables \(\overline{X}_n\) is less than or equal to \(N\) times the expected value of the square of a sample proportion \(\overline{P}\).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Both inequalities are essentially stating that the sum of the expected values of the squares of the random variables (or their sample means) is bounded by a linear function of the expected value of the square of a constant or a sample proportion.

### Final Answer

\[
\boxed{\sum_{n=1}^N\mathbb{E}(X_n^2) \leq N\cdot P, \quad \sum_{n=1}^N\mathbb{E}(\overline{X}_n^2) \leq N\cdot \overline{P}}
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{\sum_{n=1}^N\mathbb{E}(X_n^2) \leq N\cdot P, \quad \sum_{n=1}^N\mathbb{E}(\overline{X}_n^2) \leq N\cdot \overline{P}}\).
