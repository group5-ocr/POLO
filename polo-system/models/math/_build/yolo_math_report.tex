Let's break down the given equation \( S \times S \) step by step.

### Example
\[ S \times S \]

### Explanation
The symbol \( S \) represents a set. The expression \( S \times S \) denotes the Cartesian product of the set \( S \) with itself. The Cartesian product of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) is the set of all ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a \) is an element of \( A \) and \( b \) is an element of \( B \). In this case, since both sets are \( S \), the Cartesian product \( S \times S \) is the set of all ordered pairs \((s_1, s_2)\) where \( s_1 \) and \( s_2 \) are elements of \( S \).

### Conclusion
The core purpose of the equation \( S \times S \) in the context of the paper is to represent the Cartesian product of a set with itself. This operation is often used in various mathematical and statistical contexts, particularly when dealing with sets of data or outcomes.

Let's break down the given equation step by step, following the order you've specified.

### Example
The equation is:
\[
\Pr(\textrm{ Object}) * \textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}}
\]

### Explanation
1. **\(\Pr(\textrm{ Object})\)**: This represents the probability of the event "Object". In simpler terms, it's the likelihood that a certain event (the "Object") occurs.
2. **\(\textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}}\)**: This term is a bit more complex. It seems to be a function or a specific notation that we need to interpret. Given the context, it might represent a specific operation or value related to "推" (推) and "真" (真). However, without additional context, it's challenging to provide a precise interpretation. For now, let's assume it represents a value related to the operation "推" and "真".

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to calculate the probability of an event (the "Object") and then apply a specific operation ( related to "推" and "真") to this probability. The exact nature of this operation depends on the specific context in which this equation is used.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\text{The probability of the "Object" multiplied by a value related to "推" and "真".}}

Let's break down the given equation step by step, following the order provided:

### Example
The equation is:
\[
\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{ Object})
\]

### Explanation
This equation represents the probability that an object belongs to a specific class \(i\), given the object. Let's break it down further:

1. **\(\Pr\)**: This is the probability function.
2. **\(\textrm{Class}_i\)**: This represents the class we are interested in. The index \(i\) indicates which class we are considering.
3. **\(|\)**: This is the conditional probability symbol, meaning "given".
4. **\(\textrm{ Object}\)**: This represents the object we are considering.

So, the equation \(\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{ Object})\) means "the probability that the object belongs to class \(i\)".

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to calculate the probability that a given object belongs to a specific class. This is a common task in machine learning and pattern recognition, where we often need to classify objects into different categories based on their features.

\[

Let's break down the given equation step by step, following the order you've specified.

### Example
The equation is:
\[
\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{Object}) * \Pr(\textrm{Object}) * \textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}} = \Pr(\textrm{Class}_i) * \textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}}
\]

### Explanation
1. **\(\Pr(\textrm{Class}_i | \textrm{Object})\)**: This represents the probability that the object belongs to class \(i\), given that we know the object is in the set of objects.
2. **\(\Pr(\textrm{Object})\)**: This represents the probability that the object is in the set of objects.
3. **\(\textrm{IOU}_{\textrm{推}}^{\textrm{真}}\)**: This represents the information used for推断, and it is true.

The left side of the equation is the product of the probability that the object belongs to class \(i\) given the object is in the set of objects, the probability that the object is in the set of objects, and the information used for推断 that is true.

The right side of the equation is the product of the probability that the object belongs to class \(i\) and the information used for推断 that is true.

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to show that the probability of an object belonging to a certain class, given that the object is in the set of objects, and the probability of the object being in the set of objects, multiplied by the information used for推断 that is true, is equal to the probability of the object belonging to that class, multiplied by the information used for推断 that is true.

In simpler terms, it is saying that the probability of an object being in a certain class, given that it is in the set of objects, is proportional to the probability of the object being in the set of objects, and the information used for推断 that is true.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The probability of an object belonging to a certain class, given that it is in the set of objects, is proportional to the probability of the

1. **Example**: The equation is \( S \times S \times (B*5 + C) \).

2. **Explanation**:
   - \( S \): This represents a variable or a constant.
   - \( S \times S \): This means \( S \) is multiplied by itself, which is equivalent to \( S^2 \).
   - \( B*5 \): This means the variable \( B \) is multiplied by 5.
   - \( B*5 + C \): This means the result of \( B*5 \) is added to the constant \( C \).
   - The entire expression \( S^2 \times (B*5 + C) \) means that the result of \( S^2 \) is multiplied by the result of \( B*5 + C \).

3. **Conclusion**: The core purpose of this equation is to calculate a certain value based on the variables and constants involved. In the context of the paper, it could be related to a loss function, a normalization factor, or some other statistical or machine learning concept, but without additional context, we can only say that it involves squaring \( S \) and then multiplying it by the sum of \( B \) multiplied by 5 and \( C \).

So, the final answer is:

Let's break down the given piecewise function step by step.

### Example
The given equation is:
\[
\phi(x) =
\begin{cases}
    x, & \text{if } x > 0\\
    0.1x, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

### Explanation
1. ** symbol**: This is the piecewise function notation. It means that the function \(\phi(x)\) has different definitions depending on the value of \(x\).
2. **if \(x > 0\)**: If the value of \(x\) is greater than 0, then \(\phi(x) = x\). This means that \(\phi(x)\) is equal to \(x\) itself.
3. **otherwise**: If the value of \(x\) is not greater than 0 (i.e., \(x \leq 0\)), then \(\phi(x) = 0.1x\). This means that \(\phi(x)\) is equal to 0.1 times \(x\).

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to define a function \(\phi(x)\) that behaves differently depending on the value of \(x\). Specifically, it returns \(x\) if \(x\) is positive, and \(0.1x\) if \(x\) is non-positive. This type of function is often used in machine learning and optimization to introduce non linearity or to weight certain parts of the input differently based on their value.

### Explanation
1. ** symbol**: This is the piecewise function notation, which means the function \( f(x) \) is defined in two parts.
2. ** if \( x > 0 \)**: This is the condition for the first part of the function. If \( x \) is greater than 0, then \( f(x) = x \).
3. ** 0.1x**: This is the expression for the second part of the function. If \( x \) is not greater than 0 (i.e., \( x \leq 0 \)), then \( f(x) = 0.1x \).

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to define a function \( f(x) \) that returns \( x \) if \( x \) is positive and \( 0.1x \) if \( x \) is non-positive. This can be useful in various contexts, such as in machine learning where you might want to apply different transformations based on the sign of a variable.

### Final Answer

   In this context, \(\mathbbm{1}_i^{\text{ objective}}\) indicates that the indicator function is applied to the condition "objective".

2. ** symbol**: The exponent \(\text{ objective}\) is the condition or the context in which the indicator function is applied. It could be a specific event or a set of criteria that the index \(i\) must satisfy.

### Conclusion
The core purpose of this equation is to indicate whether a certain condition (in this case, "objective") is satisfied for a given index \(i\). If the condition is met, the indicator function returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0. This is a common way to represent binary conditions in mathematical expressions.

So, the final answer is:
