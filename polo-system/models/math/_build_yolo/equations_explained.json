The expression \\( S \\times S \\) denotes the Cartesian product of the set \\( S \\) with itself. The Cartesian product of two sets \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is the set of all ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\( a \\) is an element of \\( A \\) and \\( b \\) is an element of \\( B \\). In this case, since both sets are \\( S \\), the Cartesian product \\( S \\times S \\) is the set of all ordered pairs \\((s_1, s_2)\\) where both \\( s_1 \\) and \\( s_2 \\) are elements of \\( S \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe core purpose of the equation \\( S \\times S \\) in the context of the paper could be to represent the set of all possible pairs of elements from the set \\( S \\). This is often used in various mathematical and statistical contexts, such as in probability theory or machine learning, where the Cartesian product is used to define the sample space of a random variable or to represent the set of all possible outcomes of a pair of events.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion could be:\nThe equation \\( S \\times S \\) represents the set of all ordered pairs of elements from the set \\( S \\), which is useful in contexts where the Cartesian product is used to define the sample space or possible outcomes of a pair of events.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{S \\times S}\n\\]"

In simpler terms, it's the likelihood that a certain event (the \"Object\") occurs.\n2. **\\(\\textrm{IOU}_{\\textrm{推}}^{\\textrm{真}}\\)**: This part of the equation is a bit more complex.
